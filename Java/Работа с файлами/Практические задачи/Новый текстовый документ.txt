        Mikhail Lermontov
            Borodino
- Tell me, uncle, it's not for nothing
Moscow burned by fire
given to the French?
After all, there were fighting battles,
Yes, they say, what else!
No wonder the whole of Russia remembers
About the day of Borodin!

- Yes, there were people in our time,
Not like the current tribe:
Bogatyrs are not you!
They got a bad share:
Few returned from the field ...
Do not be the Lord's will,
They wouldn't give up Moscow!

We retreated silently for a long time,
It was annoying, they were waiting for the battle,
The old people grumbled:
“What are we? for winter quarters?
Do not dare, or something, commanders
Aliens tear up their uniforms
About Russian bayonets?

And here we found a large field:
There is a roam where at will!
They built a redoubt.
Our ears are on top!
A little morning lit up the guns
And forests blue tops -
The French are right here.

I scored a charge in the cannon tight
And I thought: I will treat a friend!
Wait a minute, brother Musyu!
What is there to be cunning, perhaps for battle;
We will go to break the wall,
Let's keep our heads up
For your homeland!

For two days we were in a skirmish.
What's the use of such nonsense?
We waited the third day.
Everywhere speeches began to be heard:
"Time to get to the buckshot!"
And here on the field of a formidable battle
The night shadow fell.

I lay down to take a nap at the gun carriage,
And it was heard before dawn,
How the French rejoiced.
But our open bivouac was quiet:
Who cleaned the shako all battered,
Who sharpened the bayonet, grumbling angrily,
Biting a long mustache.

And the sky just lit up
Everything suddenly stirred,
The formation flashed behind the formation.
Our colonel was born with a grip:
Servant to the king, father to the soldiers...
Yes, sorry for him: struck by damask steel,
He sleeps in the damp earth.

And he said, his eyes sparkling:
"Guys! Isn't Moscow behind us?
Let's die near Moscow
How our brothers died!”
And we promised to die
And the oath of allegiance was kept
We are in the battle of Borodino.

Well, it was a day! Through the flying smoke
The French moved like clouds
And all to our redoubt.
Lancers with colorful badges,
Dragoons with ponytails
All flashed before us
Everyone has been here.

You will not see such battles! ..
Worn banners like shadows
Fire gleamed in the smoke
Damask steel sounded, buckshot screeched,
The hand of the fighters is tired of stabbing,
And prevented the nuclei from flying
A mountain of bloody bodies.

The enemy knew a lot that day,
What does the Russian fight remote mean,
Our hand-to-hand combat!
The earth shook like our breasts
Mixed in a bunch of horses, people,
And the volleys of a thousand guns
Merged into a long howl ...

Here it is dark. Were all ready
In the morning start a new fight
And stand to the end...
Here the drums crackle -
And the busurmans retreated.
Then we began to count the wounds,
Count comrades.

Yes, there were people in our time,
Mighty, dashing tribe:
Bogatyrs are not you.
They got a bad share:
Few returned from the field.
If it weren't for God's will,
They wouldn't give up Moscow!
